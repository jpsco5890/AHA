Auto Homology-Appending

Program for generating overhangs of homology to add to primers for amplifying inserts and vector backbones for homologous recombination mediated plasmid construction.

	-i/--insert:	This flag prompts the program to open the specified file to access the insert
			sequences (Should be in FASTA format).
	-v/--vector:	This flag prompts the program to open the specified file to access the vector
			sequence (Should be in FASTA format). Additionally, this flag can be used to specify a
			pre-loaded vector (e.g. pJQ200sk)
	-p/--printFile:	This flag prompts the program to write the primer sequences to the specified file.
	-h/--help:	This flag will print this screen then quit the program.

See README.md for more information and examples.
